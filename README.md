# LabVision

Welcome to the CTL Machine Learning Application project! This is an Android application that leverages [Google MLKit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/) to identify components of machinery used within the Collaborative Teaching Laboratory at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx).

The models used in the application are trained using the [TensorFlow Lite Model Maker](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker). They are Image Classification models, created using images taken within the labs and labelled with [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg), created by [Tzuta Lin](http://tzutalin.github.io/).

## Overview üìù

This Android application was designed to aid in the identification of machinery components within the Collaborative Teaching Laboratory (CTL) at the University of Birmingham. With the help of Google's MLKit, we can harness the power of machine learning to achieve our goals. 

## Features üéÆ

- Identification of machinery components via MLKit
- Utilizes Image Classification models trained by TensorFlow Lite Model Maker
- Easy-to-use Android application

## Documentation üìö

A detailed breakdown of the development and maintenance of the application can be found in our [documentation](https://github.com/Jack-Development/LabVison/blob/main/CTL_AR_Training_Documentation_2_0.pdf).
